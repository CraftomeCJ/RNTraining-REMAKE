➜  ~ pod --version
1.10.1
- Create your own Github Account
https://github.com/ and create your own github account
You should have a github account like 
https://github.com/yourusername
- Create your own Github repository
Login your github account and create your repository called RNTraining-REMAKE
You should a repository called RNTraining-REMAKE in your github accounnt
- Get the react native starter project from Github
Install git using: brew install git
Prepare create a folder in your mac called RNTraining
Go to RNTraining and run
git clone https://github.com/huanganya/react-native-starter
After step1, you should get this:
➜  ~ git --version
git version 2.32.0 (Apple Git-132)

After step 3, you should get this:

➜ ls

## Room to improve?

- Had make good progress on practice to time-boxing my task to 90 minutes per self-assigned task.
- Continue to work on the more advance React Native concepts, its feature, workflows and how to use it with some CSS fundamentals.
- required more efforts on refactoring and TypeScript understanding ie interface and extends for type protection.
- Day 26 is continue to learn and practice on Day 15 & 16 notes of React Native concepts and at the same time work on TypeScript conversion, behind schedule by 2.5 days.
- Practice more to have better understanding of the useState & useReducer with other tutorials.
- Layout of working journal now look good, from day 26 onwards will improve on technical writing of learning experience and daily lesson task reviews with a better layout.
- Add one more column for technical book's chapter summary for future reference.
- add one more column for non-technical book's chapter summary for future reference.
- To learn and master better file management on using .gif to showcase course's challenge work and .png folder for error and warning messages display.
